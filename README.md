## About
This is a Java-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game selects a random tech-related word, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word one letter at a time. Test your technology vocabulary knowledge in a fun command-line experience.

**Some features:**

- Detects repeated guesses.
- Input validation for non single-letter or any other invalid entries.
- Console-based UI with colorized output.

**Project Structure:**

```
